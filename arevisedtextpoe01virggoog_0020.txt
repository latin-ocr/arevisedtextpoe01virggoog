volume of his edition ot Pliny’s Natural History, where it in nni·
rormly Vergilius. ’

Tho correct torm was known to the learned Politimus ot
the fisteenth. century, and was restored in several of· tho earliest
printed editions ot the works of Vergil, both Italian 'and Ger·
man3 but the monkish authority was too strong for them.

Nem-ly halt a. century ago German philologiam began onoo
more to write the name in ite proper form. Tho earliest exam·
ples 1 have found are in Fickert's Pliny, 1842, and Obbarins's
Prudentius, 1845. The German philologioal anaguina soon
adopted both Vergilius and Vergil; Vergilian editore, as FrenmL
in 1851, ‘and Ladowig, in his edition of 1854, ventured to nse tho
oorreot form, and the example was followed by the editore of
Latin classice generally3 so that the misspelled word has now
disappeared from nearly all German philologioal end classical
writings, exeepting old publications, and repr-inte of old editions.

In England and Amorion the eorroooed Latin form is used
by all the beet authorities, sneh aa the Latin grammate ot Roby,
Bru-lmese, and Gilderpleeve, tho Harpere' Latin Dietionary‚ rep-
resenting the scholarship ot Short and Levis, and other eminent
Latinium, tho Conington edition of Vergil, by far tho toremost
English edition ot the present century, and by the American
Journal of Philology. , Many, indeed, stin adhere to tho Eny-
lislt‘ form, while admitting the proper spelling in Latin. But,
ot eom-ee, the incongruity of Vergilius and Vix-gil oan not long
be ιοΙοὶ-αιοᾱ, and the latter, as in Gen-many, munt. epeedils follow
its cognate of tho dark ages.
