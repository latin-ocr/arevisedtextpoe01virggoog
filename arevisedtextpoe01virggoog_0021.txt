Pusu'us Vnncmus Hm was born at Andes, a village near
Mantua, in‘the consulship of Pompey and crassus, n. o. ⁷0. Ver-
gil's father possessed a farm at Andes sufficieutly valuable to
place his family in easy circumstances, and to affor-d him the
means of educating his son under the most eminent teachers then
living iu Italy. The education of Vergil appears to have been

commenced at Cremona, from whence, on assuming the manly ’

gown, in his sixteenth year, he was transferred to the charge ot
new teachers at Milan.

. After pursuing his studies, probably for several years, at ⁸

Milan, he placed himself under the instruction of the Greek poet
and grammarian, Parthenius, who was then flourishing at Naples.
At the age of twenty-three he left Naplesfor Rome, where he
finished his education under Syro the Epicurean, en accomplished-
teacher of philosophy, mathematice, and physice. ·
· Vergil' s love of literary pursuits, as well as the delicacy of his
physical constitution, led him to choose a life of retirement rather
than that public career which was more generally deemed proper
for a Roman citizen. Hence, at the age when espiring young
Romans usually entered upon the stirring soenes of political and
military life, he withdrew trorn Rome to his native Andes, with
the intention of devoting himself to agriculture, ecience, and let·
tere. The Sicilicn Greek, Theocritus, was at this time his favor-
ite author, and it was from him that the general plan, though not
the individua! character, of the Bucolics was derived.
