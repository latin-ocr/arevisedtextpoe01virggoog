But though liable to auch criticiams, the Ecloguee are 'among
the most graceful and beautiful 01 all idyllic poema, and they pos-
eeee a charm which fascinatee the reader more and more with
every perusal.

The Eclogues established the reputation 01 the poet, and gained
him at once ardent friends and admirere among the most pow er-
ful and the most cultivated of the Romane. Among thece, be-
sides hia early and fast friend Pollio, were Octavian, Maecenas,
Varius, Horace, and Propertius. Theae and all other educated
Romana ot the day regarded Vergil aa already superior in many
respecta to any poet who had yet appeared. It was most of all
in the exquisite finish and harmony of hie hexametera that he ex·
celled all who had preceded him. The hexameter verae had been
first introduced into the Latin language, at the close ot the second
Punic war, by the soldier and poet Ennius. But though ‹listin-
guished by originality, strength, and vigor, the poetry of Ennius
was hareb and rngged to a degree which rendered it to the more
cultivated taatce of later generatione almost intolerahle. Nor by
the poets who aucmded Ennius had any such improvement been
made in the composition of Latin verae aa to admit ot any com·
parison between them and their Grecian medela. It was reserved
for two great poete of Rome, two congenial spirite, filled with the
most lively admiration 01 each other, labor-ing aide by side, both
atriving earneatly for the same object—it was reserved for Vergil
and Horace ιο elevate the national poetry to a character worthy
of Rome, to develop all the resourcee of their noble language, and
to make it flow both' ln heroic and lyrio verse with all the grace
and dignity that had hitherto been characteristic of the Greek
alone.

After the publication of the mogum, Vergil appears to have
passed the remainder of hia lite chiefly at Naplea. His feeble
health was probably themon of this.

It was here'that' ‘he composed the Georgica, a didactic poem
in tour books, in which he endeavora to recall the Italiana to their
primitive but long-neglected pursuit of agriculture. In point of
versification thia ia the most finished of the vorke of our poet,
