tude found utteranoe in the beautiful hymn called the sourth
Eologue, in whioh he hails the suspicione times just dawning on
the world, and initiated by the consulship of hiefriend and patron
Pollio in n. ο. 40. The sixth Eologue was oomposed in the fol-
lowing year, n. o. 89, in fulffllment of. a promise made to vam*
The eighth wne written iu the autumn of the earne year in honor
of Pollio, who had gained a brilliant victory over the Parthini, a
people of Dalmatia. The two remaining Eologuee, the neventh
and tenth, were probably eompoeed in the two following years.

Though the· material of the Bucolica is taken largely from
Theocritus, end to some extent from other Greek poete, yet Ver·
gil hue giren to most of them something of α national oharueter
by associating thie foreign material with circumstances end per·
nonages pertaining to his own time and country. In the firet und
ninth EologueS, for example, he describes with deep feeling, in
the dialogues of the ehepherdss, the sooiul minei-ies attending the -
ware of the triumvirate, und in the fourth he dwelle with delight
ou the anticipated return ot peuoe and bleeeedneee under the reign
of Octavian. In the first, again, he finde, or rather makes for
himself, the opportunity of expreeeing bie grateful love end ed·
miration of the youthful emperor, while ln the fifth he commem·
oratee, under the name of Daphnis, the greatness and the untimely
death of the deifled Caesar, Finally, in the eixtb und tenth, in
the midst of mytho und fancies derived from hie Greoiun masten,
he has immortalized the nume of his friend Cornelius Gallus.

The seenery of the Eologuee, es well ue the munnere and ous-
toms of the husbandmen who'mnke up their pemnml, are quite
ne much Sioiliau ee Italian. It is unfortunate, too, that Vergil hee
glven these poema a. still οἷοι-ο foreign air by the use of Greek ln·
eteud 01 Italian names But this was the teste of the times. He
laborq eleo, under another diadumeno, as compared with The·
oei-itus, in the went of a Latin dialect euituble for shepherds and
herdsman, or, at least, in not employing one. nWhile the Sieilian
Greek pastoral generally uses a form ot epeeoh approximating
closely to the nature of ite rustic characters, the lunguage ot Ver·
gil’s ehepherde is too mnoh like finnt ot cultivated society.
