found in the best manuscripts, the critica of whom 1 have
spoken have laid the foundation of a. general scheme of Latin
orthography, which we may reasonably accept as representing
the best period 01 the.1anguage in its external or orthographi-
eal form. This period was the age of Quintilian or the period
extending from Nero to Hadrian—A. n. 54-118. The best re·
suits of these investigatione sre embodied in the works of wu-
helm Brambaeh.* The system which he has proposed has met
with general aeceptance‚ and is likely to impress itself on all
future editions of Latin authors.

In the present text 1 have in general adopted the spelling
proposed by Brambaeh3 following, at the same time, his sug-
gestion as to the treatment of those writers ot the Augustan
age, such-as Livy and Vergil, who are alleged to have had a
fondness for the ,old-fashioned formssl'

The mest characteristic feature of this archaie spelling is
the form vo in such words as have usually been written with
eu ,· .as solque, volnus, een-vos, volt, vivont, divom, and the like-
forms which occur -so frequently in some editions ot Vergil that
they give the poet the appearance, as compared with his friend
Horacerof. one ot the ancients of a century or two earlier.

Other recent-or living scholas-s have pursued a more mod-
erate course in the treatment ol! the Vergiliau text3 giving it a]
little of the ‘archaic colei-ing, but not rendering it a complete
likeness of Plautus or Lucilius. Indeed, no two of the critics
ot this class can perfeetly agree in their results; for the res*
