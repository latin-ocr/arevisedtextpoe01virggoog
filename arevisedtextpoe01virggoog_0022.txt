the lientenant of Antony in Gaul. Pollio wss himself distin·

Under his petronsge tbe seeond, third, and fifth Eelognes had
already been written, when the liternry lsbors and the pesoeful
life of the poet were suddenly interra pted. The veterum legions
οἱ Octavian, on returning from Philippi, and demsnding the allot-
ments ot lund which hed been promised them ss s reward for
the-ir services in the civil wer, were suthon-ised ιο take possession
of eighteen Italian sities, with the district ot eountry pertsining
