respect the most perfect of all poems. In the first book he treats
of the management os fields, in the second of trees, in the third
ot horses and cattle, and in the fourth ot bees. He has gathered
into this poem all the experience of the ancient Italian· on these
subjecta, and he has contrived to make them attractiva by assc-
ciating them with wonderful beauty of diction and imagery, and
with charming variety os illustration.

Having devoted seven years, from Β. c. 87 to the writing or
this work, aud conscious that his poetic labora must be ended by
an early death, he now entered upon the long-cherished plan of
composing an Epic in the Homeric style, which should at once
commemorate the glory of Rome and of Augustus, and win back
the Romans, if possible, to the religione virtues of their progeni-
tors. He chose for his theme the fot-tunes of Aeneas, the tabled
founder of the Julian famil53 and, hence, called his epic the
Aeneid, which he divided into twelve books. He had already been ’

conveyed from Brundisium to Naples, and buried on the hill of
Posilippo, in the tomb still preserved and revered as the “ tomh
of Vergil.'’

It is edd that Vergil, a short time before his death, desired to
burn up his Aeneid‚ in consequence of the imperfect state in
which it would necessarily be left. But being dissusded from
this purpose by his friends Tucca and Varius, he directed them
in his will to striks out all the verses that were incompleta, but
to add nothing. It does not appear, however, that anything was
erased by them, unless we admit the account of some os the gram-
marians who alleged that Tucca and Varius rejected the four
