are the theme of the Eelogue. The new-born infant, thus made the sub'eet
of this immor-tal hymn, was probably Caius Asinius Pollio, son of that Po lio
whose raises our poet never tiras of repeating. The birth of a son to such
a frien eould not fail to eall forth even extravagant eongmtulntions‚ espe-
cially ss it occurred in the year of the consulship ot' Polho‚ and at a penod
when his rs utation was at the highest, and when the circumstances of the
times seem actually to be opening a new and happy era.

Itis not surprisi that early C ristian writers and many even down to
our own times, shoul regu-d this mnrvolous “ advent hymn‚” this rapt-ur-
ous vision of eom3ng lox-ies, ns. bem-in a wonderful ‘resemblnnee to ‘the

the glow of enthusiasm with which e hails the birth of the child and the
apparent dnwn of better times. ·

The student should compare this Eelogue with the sixteenth epodo of
Bornos, eomposed a year or two earlier, when Horace was as much ‹lepressod
by des ‘r ns Vergil is now fullos hope. Horace then could sse no refugo
from ge? revniling εει-ἰῶ and anarehy but in ssight far awa to the ‘⁴ For-

This Effigue is written fin a spirit something like that which characterizes
the noble hymns of Menalcas end Mopsus m the fifth. Itis the hymn of
adol-ing shepberds. And we can almost fancy them gethering around the
eradio from which fiowers are sp “ ‘ng (fundent cunabula flores), and
rejoieing with wonder over the ehxld, kao the smiling group in Correggio‘s
